      <description>I have recently created my first site using hugo, so I thought the first post should be the process of creating a site using hugo.
Step 1 - Install Hugo Go to Hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your OS and architecture.
Instructions here will be relevant for windows but can be applied to other OS with some tweaks.
Put the hugo executable into the PATH environment variable so it accessible from everywhere.</description>

      <description>Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better to take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.&amp;mdash; Carl Jung The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.&amp;mdash; Carl Jung Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.</description>
